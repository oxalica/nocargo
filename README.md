# nocargo: Cargo in Nix

üöß *This project is under development and is not ready for production yet. APIs are subjects to change.*

Build Rust crates with *Nix Build System*.
- **No IFDs** (import-from-derivation). See [meme](https://gist.github.com/oxalica/d3b1251eb29d10e6f3cb2005167ddcd9).
- No `cargo` dependency during building. Only `rustc`.
- No need for hash prefetching or code generation[^no-code-gen].
- Crate level caching, globally shared.
- [nixpkgs] integration for non-Rust dependencies.

[^no-code-gen]: Initial template generation and `Cargo.lock` updatin don't count for "code generation". The former is optional, and the latter is indeed not "code".

## Start with Nix flake

1. (Optional) Add binary substituters for pre-built popular crates, by either
   - Install `cachix` and run `cachix use nocargo` ([see more detail about `cachix`](https://app.cachix.org/cache/nocargo)), or
   - Manually add substituter `https://nocargo.cachix.org` with public key `nocargo.cachix.org-1:W6jkp5htZBA1tUdU8XHLaD7zBrIFnor0MsLhHgrJeHk=`
1. Enter the root directory of your rust workspace or package. Currently, you should have `Cargo.lock` already created by `cargo`.
1. Run `nix run github:oxalica/nocargo init` to generate `flake.nix`. Or write it by hand by following [the next section](#example-flake.nix-structure).
1. Check flake outputs with `nix flake show`. Typically, the layout would be like,
   ```
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄpackages
       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄx86_64-linux
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄdefault: package 'rust_mypkg1-0.1.0'           # The "default" package. For workspace, it's the top-level one if exists.
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmypkg1: package 'rust_mypkg1-0.1.0'            # Crate `mypkg1` with `release` profile.
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmypkg1-dev: package 'rust_mypkg1-debug-0.1.0'  # Crate `mypkg1` with `dev` profile.
           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmypkg2: package 'rust_mypkg2-0.1.0'            # etc.
           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmypkg2-dev: package 'rust_mypkg2-debug-0.1.0'
   ```
1. Run `nix build .#<pkgname>` to build your package. Built binaries (if any) will be placed in `./result/bin`, and the library will be in `./result/lib`.
1. Have fun!

## Example `flake.nix` structure for reference 

A template `flake.nix` with common setup are below. It's mostly the same as the generated one, except that the helper `noc` will scan the workspace and discover all external registries and git dependencies for you.

```nix
{
  description = "My Rust packages";

  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs";
    flake-utils.url = "github:numtide/flake-utils";
    nocargo = {
      url = "github:oxalica/nocargo";
      inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";

      # See below.
      # inputs.registry-crates-io.follows = "registry-crates-io";
    };

    # Optionally, you can explicitly import crates.io-index here.
    # So you can `nix flake update` at any time to get cutting edge version of crates,
    # instead of waiting `nocargo` to dump its dependency.
    # Otherwise, you can simply omit this to use the locked registry from `nocargo`,
    # which is updated periodically.
    # registry-crates-io = { url = "github:rust-lang/crates.io-index"; flake = false; };
  };

  outputs = { nixpkgs, flake-utils, nocargo, ... }@inputs:
    flake-utils.lib.eachSystem [ "x86_64-linux" ] (system:
      let
        # The entry API to make Nix derivations from your Rust workspace or package.
        # The output of it consists of profile names, like `release` or `dev`, each of which is
        # a attrset of all member package derivations keyed by their package names.
        ws = nocargo.lib.${system}.mkRustPackageOrWorkspace {
          # The root directory, which contains `Cargo.lock` and top-level `Cargo.toml`
          # (the one containing `[workspace]` for workspace).
          src = ./.;

          # If you use registries other than crates.io, they should be imported in flake inputs,
          # and specified here. Note that registry should be initialized via `mkIndex`,
          # with an optional override.
          extraRegistries = {
            # "https://example-registry.org" = nocargo.lib.${system}.mkIndex inputs.example-registry {};
          };

          # If you use crates from git URLs, they should be imported in flake inputs,
          # and specified here.
          gitSrcs = {
            # "https://github.com/some/repo" = inputs.example-git-source;
          };

          # If some crates in your dependency closure require packages from nixpkgs.
          # You can override the argument for `stdenv.mkDerivation` to add them.
          #
          # Popular `-sys` crates overrides are maintained in `./crates-io-override/default.nix`
          # to make them work out-of-box. PRs are welcome.
          buildCrateOverrides = with nixpkgs.legacyPackages.${system}; {
            # Use package id format `pkgname version (registry)` to reference a direct or transitive dependency.
            "zstd-sys 2.0.1+zstd.1.5.2 (registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index)" = old: {
              nativeBuildInputs = [ pkg-config ];
              propagatedBuildInputs = [ zstd ];
            };

            "mypkg1" = old: {
              nativeBuildInputs = [ git ];
            };
          };

          # We use the rustc from nixpkgs by default.
          # But you can override it, for example, with a nightly version from https://github.com/oxalica/rust-overlay
          # rustc = rust-overlay.packages.${system}.rust-nightly_2022-07-01;
        };
      in rec {
        # For convenience, we hoist derivations of `release` and `dev` profile for easy access,
        # with `dev` packages postfixed by `-dev`.
        # You can export different packages of your choice.
        packages = ws.release
          // nixpkgs.lib.mapAttrs' (name: value: { name = "${name}-dev"; inherit value; }) ws.dev
          // {
            # The "default" features are turned on by default.
            # You can `override` the library derivation to enable a different set of features.
            # Explicit overriding will disable "default", unless you manually include it.
            mypkg1-with-custom-features = (ws.release.mypkg1.override {
              # Enables two features (and transitive ones), and disables "default".
              features = [ "feature1" "feature2" ]; 
            }).bin;
          };
      });
}

## FAQ

### Comparison with [cargo2nix] and [naersk]?

Main differences are already clarified [on the top](#nocargo%3A-cargo-in-nix).

`nocargo` is inspired by `cargo2nix` and `buildRustCrate` in `nixpkgs`. We are more like `cargo2nix` while the generation part is implemented by pure Nix, but less like `naersk` which is a wrapper to call `cargo` to build the package inside derivations.

In other words, we and `cargo2nix` use Nix as a *Build System*, while `nearsk` use Nix as a *Package Manager* or *Packager*.

### But why pure Nix build system?

- Sharing through fine-grained derivations between all projects, not just in one workspace.
- Binary substitution per crate.
  No need for global `target_dir`/`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` or [sccache].
- Easy `nixpkgs` integration for non-Rust package dependencies, cross-compilation (planned) and package overriding.
- More customizability: per-crate `rustc` flags tweaking, arbitrary crate patching, force dynamic linking and more.

### Can I really throw away `cargo`?

Sorry, currently no. :crying_cat_face: Updating of `Cargo.lock` still relies on `cargo`.
This can happen when creating a new project or changing dependencies.
We are mainly using `cargo`'s SAT solver to pin down the dependency graph.

It's *possible* to implement it ourselves, but not yet, due to the complexity.
